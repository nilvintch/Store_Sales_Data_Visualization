#Global store sales data visualisation and Analysis using tableau
Introduction:
The following report presents a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the Global Superstore sales data. The dataset comprises 51,290 rows and 26 fields, detailing various aspects of orders, customers, products, and shipping. The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into sales trends, profitability, and shipping patterns across different categories, sub-categories, segments, and regions.
Visualization and Analysis:
1. Profit by Category:
A bar graph was generated to visualize the sales, discounts, and profit for each category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology). It was observed that despite heavy discounts, the Furniture category experienced a reduction in profit.
 
2. Shipping Modes:
A donut chart was used to represent the distribution of shipping modes.
The "Standard Class" shipping mode emerged as the most popular choice, accounting for 60% of shipments.
 
3. Sales by Segment:
A bar graph was created to showcase the sales for different segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office). The consumer segment exhibited the highest sales, reaching 6,500,000 units.
 
4. Category Comparison:
A bar graph was generated to compare the sales performance of different categories. Technology products were the top sellers, while Office Supplies showed the lowest sales.
 
5. Sales vs. Profit by Sub-Category:
A bar graph was utilized to display sales values, with a superimposed line graph illustrating the fluctuation of profit across sub-categories. This visualization helped to understand the correlation between sales and profit for various sub-categories.
6. Table Dashboard:
A comprehensive table dashboard was created, integrating all the key visualizations. A filter was added to the "Sales by Country" graph, allowing users to focus on countries with higher profits (dark green) or losses (red). The dashboard is responsive and updates dynamically when the selected country is changed.
